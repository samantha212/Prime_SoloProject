Song Shaker Set Maker 

Jan-March 2016

This is my Individual Capstone Project for Prime Digital Academy.  

This web application allows professional musicians to ease their jobs by generating setlists on their behalf.  Each registered user receives access to the Song Shaker Standard Library of over 200 songs.  Users are also able to add songs to their Custom Library.  

A user can decide which songs are eligible to be potentially used in a setlist by activating or inactivating songs from the Standard Library and Custom Library pages. 

They can then go to the Set Maker page, enter the required information for their set and click "Shake it!".  Song Shaker Set Maker then takes over.  Using logic developed using insight shared by a professional musician, Song Shaker develops setlists that can be used at Wedding Receptions and Corporate Events!
